## Project description

This project demonstrated the use of stacks in queues in C++. The first part of the project would parse though an HTML document, and verify if the HTML were balanced. Balanced means that every open tag has a close tag, and the last open tag would be closed before any previous open tag was closed. The second part of the project is a basic web crawler. The program would parse though the HTML documents, and check for any anchor tags in the documents. It would then check to see if it was a valid anchor tab. If so, it would visit the other page and the cycle would continue until there were no more pages to visit. It would then print the total number of pages that each of the documents could visit.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile and run the project.

```bash
cd ./htmlParsingAndCrawling
g++ main.cpp
./a.out
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
